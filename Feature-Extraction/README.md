# Root Directory for Feature Extraction programs

This directory acts as a hub for containing all autoencoder projects intended to demonstrate feature extraction use-cases. Each subdirectory present within this folder contains its own readme, and can be treated as a completed project for demonstration purposes -- complete with both the fully-documented jupyter notebook code and the trained model weights as of the final checkpoints in the most recent run prior to upload. 

## Project: Convolutional-Autoencoder

This project demonstrates the use of a convolutional neural network to perform autoencoding for feature extraction on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. For a more thorough description of the project and its files, see the readme located within the respective subdirectory. 

## Project: Dense-Autoencoder

This project demonstrates the use of a fully-connected (dense) neural network to perform autoencoding for feature extraction on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset. For a more thorough description of the project and its files, see the readme located within the respective subdirectory.
